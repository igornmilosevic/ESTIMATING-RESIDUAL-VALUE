Research paper : "ESTIMATING RESIDUAL VALUE OF HEAVY CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT  USING THE ENSEMBLE LEARNING"

This page provides information about machines that are used in experiments that have been shown in scientific paper within the Journal of Construction Engineering and Management (ASCE) (reference).
 Process of data acquisition, merging data from different sites and deduplication of records  was done by the US company Fast Iron (https://www.fastiron.com/). In research data-driven model for the estimation of the residual value of heavy construction equipment is proposed. Data set with name "Data_set_cleaned.csv" in this page is derived set used in experiments.
